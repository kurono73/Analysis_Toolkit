# Analysis_Toolkit
The **Analysis Toolkit** is a set of measurement and calculation tools for Blender.

All tools are located in the 3D Viewport's sidebar (press `N` to open) under the **"Analysis Toolkit"** tab.
## 1. UV SS(Screen Space) Resolution

This tool calculates the required texture resolution for the selected object's screen based on the active camera, UV unwrapping data, and rendering resolution. 

Understanding the optimal texture resolution helps identify insufficient or excessive textures.It can also be used to calculate the resolution of camera projection and embedded images.

### Interface

- **Target Object:** The mesh object to analyze.
- **Target Pixel Ratio:** The desired ratio of texture pixels to screen pixels. A value of 100% aims for a 1:1 mapping where one texture pixel covers one screen pixel.
- **UDIM Base Resolution:** The standard resolution of a single UDIM tile (e.g., 2048x2048) used to calculate the suggested tile count.
- **Recalculate at Current Position:** Recalculation when camera/object is moved in viewport.
- **Calculation Results**
    - **Effective Resolution:** The calculated, non-power-of-two resolution required to meet the Target Pixel Ratio.
    - **Recommended Single Texture Resolution:** The nearest power-of-two texture resolution (e.g., 2048x2048, 4096x4096) that covers the effective resolution.
    - **Suggestion UDIM Tiles:** The number of UDIM tiles needed to achieve the effective resolution, based on the selected UDIM Base Resolution.

### Workflow

1. Select the **Target Object**.
2. Select the camera to use for analysis.
3. Adjust the **Target Pixel Ratio** to define the desired texture quality.
4. If using a UDIM workflow, select the appropriate **UDIM Base Resolution**.
5. When you change any parameter, the results will be updated automatically. If you move the camera or object in the viewport, click **Recalculate**.
6. Use the **Recommended Resolution** or **UDIM Suggestion** as a guide for creating or scaling your textures.

## 2. Illuminance Meter

This tool allows you to measure the illuminance (in Lux) at multiple points within your scene using the Cycles render engine, enabling physically-based lighting adjustments.

Sun correction compensates for clipped or underexposed HDRIs based on measured illuminance values at the time of capture.

It is especially useful for VFX look development or architectural lighting design.


>ðŸ’¡note:    
>It can also be used when using Eevee, but measurements are taken using the Cycles engine.  
>These are only reference values and are not guaranteed to match reality.



### Interface

- **1. Sensor Management:**
    - **Add Sensor:** Creates a new arrow-shaped Empty at the 3D cursor's location. All sensors are automatically placed in a dedicated collection named "LightMeter Sensors".
- **2. Correction Settings:**
    - **EV Compensation:**This setting is important when you want to match the calculated values to real-world light meter readings.In CG, lighting that appears visually correct is typically the result of a camera applying exposure compensation to achieve a proper-looking image.  
    EV Compensation converts visually adjusted exposure back to **0 EV physical luminance**, allowing illuminance to be calculated and displayed on an absolute physical scale.  
    The EV value can be derived from exposure data recorded during **HDRI creation,** or from metadata embedded in**VFX plates or source photography**.  
    If the original exposure reference is unknown, entering an estimated EV value for the environment will produce results that are closer to real-world illuminance levels.

        - EV calculation from metadata ï¼š `EV Calculator`)
    
- **3. Measurement & Results:**
    - **Illuminance measurement:** Triggers a series of quick renders to measure the illuminance at the location and orientation of every sensor in the "LightMeter Sensors" collection.
    - **Average Lux:** The mathematical average of all successful measurements.
    - **Min / Max:** The lowest and highest Lux values recorded among all sensors.
    - **Individual Results:** A list displaying the name and measured Lux value for each sensor.
    - **Save Results as CSV:**Saves the names and lux values of all measured sensors to a CSV file.
- **Sun Correction:**
    - **Sun Object:** A pointer to select the `Sun` light in your scene.
    - **Basis Sensor:**The sensor to use as a reference for adjusting the sun's strength.
    - **Target Lux:** The desired illuminance value you want to achieve.
    - **Adjust Sun Strength:** Automatically adjusts the selected `Sun` light's strength so that the **currently elected sensor** receives the specified `Target Lux`.The Sun light will be adjusted to the target illuminance, taking into account all other valid lighting, including the World light.

### Workflow

- **Illuminance measurement:**
1. Click **Add Sensor** and place the new sensor empties at the points of interest in your scene. Orient the arrows to point towards the direction you want to measure from (the arrow points away from the measurement surface).
2. Click **Measure All Sensors**. The addon will process each sensor and display the results.
3. Measurement results can be saved in CSV format if necessary.
- **Sun Correction**
1. To match a real-world lighting condition, select a specific sensor, select your `Sun` light, enter a `Target Lux`, and click **Adjust Sun Strength**.
2. Click **Measure All Sensors** again to check if the target illuminance is achieved.


>ðŸ’¡When correcting a clipped HDRI, measure the actual illuminance on-site and use the known **inverse EV correction** value of the created HDRI.  
>Sun correction results and dark scenes will have some errors in the results due to sampling accuracy issues.
